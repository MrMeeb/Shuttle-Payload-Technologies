# Shuttle-Payload-Technologies

Shuttle Payload Technologies' main goal is to provide a range of payloads for you to use with your space shuttles, whether it is for your career save or just to make some cool looking missions. These payloads will range from the space laboratory Spacelab to deployable science instruments such as the LDEF, and will also include payload mounting solutions, for you to easily mount your own payloads in a variety of fashions!

The mod has been designed to also work with Comorant Aeronology, and plays a main role in supporting the parts provided to truly enhance your shuttle experience. An important part that has been added is the CRG-150 - a slightly stretched CRG-100, which is more to scale with the rest of the Mk3 parts, and allows for even greater payload capacity!
